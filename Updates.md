Arnav : In file B-cos_computer_vision i have tried to modified version of VGG16light with a B-cos layer added at the end of the forward method. This layer normalizes the output using the L2 norm, aligning with the B-cos network approach.
Updated the training and evaluation process accordingly. Used a cosine similarity-based loss function and include cosine accuracy as an evaluation metric.
This updated code implements a cosine similarity-based loss function (cosine_loss) and incorporates cosine accuracy calculation (cosine_accuracy) in the evaluation process. The training loop now uses cosine_loss for optimization, and the validation function calculates both validation loss and cosine accuracy.
#Feel free to make any changes


More Suggestions for Architecture update:-
1. We can try to Augment our dataset to artificially increase its size and diversity. This might improve the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
we can use techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotations.
2. We can also Experiment with different optimizers like Adam.
Adjust the learning rate.
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
