Arnav : In file B-cos_computer_vision i have tried to modified version of VGG16light with a B-cos layer added at the end of the forward method. This layer normalizes the output using the L2 norm, aligning with the B-cos network approach.
Updated the training and evaluation process accordingly. Used a cosine similarity-based loss function and include cosine accuracy as an evaluation metric.
